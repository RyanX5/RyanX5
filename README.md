### 🎬 About Me  (just a little bit)


I'm **Rohan Upadhyay**, a rising sophomore at **Fisk Univeristy** majoring in Computer Science 💻.

I'm very much interested in **AI** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🤖.

I also love **Image Manipulation** 🖼️ and the theory behind it. My first introduction to Image Processing was when I created a Painting-To-Music converter program for my
Honors Arts project in my first year. Check it out [here](https://github.com/RyanX5/PaintingToMusic) 📑
