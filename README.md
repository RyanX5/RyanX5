### 🎬 About Me  (just a little bit)


I'm **Rohan Upadhyay**, a rising sophomore at **Fisk Univeristy** majoring in Computer Science 💻.

I'm very much interested in **AI** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 🤖.

I also love **Image Manipulation** 🖼️ and the theory behind it. My first introduction to Image Processing was when I created a Painting-To-Music converter program for my
Honors Arts project in my first year. Check it out [here](https://github.com/RyanX5/PaintingToMusic) 📑

# Hi there! 👋 I'm Rohan Upadhyay

I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics double major student at Fisk University with a passion for AI/ML and Game Development. 

### Projects 🚀

Here are some of my notable projects:

1. **[Worder](https://github.com/RyanX5/Worder)**: An AI-powered word guessing game where the computer selects a random word, and players have to guess it. The computer provides hints about how close the guessed word is to the original one using word2vec. Built with Unity.

2. **[Painting-To-Music](https://github.com/RyanX5/PaintingToMusic)**: A Python program that takes in the pixels of an image and turns them into musical notes. I created this project for my Honors Arts class, exploring the correlation between music and visual arts.

3. **[Calculus-Solver](https://github.com/RyanX5/CalcSolve)**: A Python-based program that aims to solve calculus problems while showing the step-by-step solutions. Currently a work in progress.

4. **[VELOCITY](https://sinisterx5.itch.io/velocity)**: An exciting Unity-based infinite side-scrolling game I created for a game jam on itch.io. It ranked 2nd overall in the competition!

5. **Quickadd**: Simplify event and reminder management on your Google Calendar using your terminal/console. This project utilizes the Google Calendar API for seamless integration.

Feel free to explore these projects and provide feedback or collaborate with me on any of them!🎓
